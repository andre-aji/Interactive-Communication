<h3>An Interactive Communication for the Chief Marketing Executive at
NYC Department of Housing Preservation &amp; Development (HPD)</h3>
<p>New York City’s rent-stabilized housing stock functions as the city’s
primary affordability infrastructure, providing a regulatory buffer that
insulates low- and moderate-income renters from volatile market
conditions. Yet over the past decade, this system has undergone
sustained contraction.</p>
<p>As Figure 1 and Table 1 show, the city lost rent-stabilized units
every year from 2015 through 2023—roughly 42,000 units in
total—indicating a systemic decline rather than short-term fluctuation.
The sharpest contractions coincide with regulatory and market
transitions, including the pre-2019 deregulation environment, the
implementation of HSTPA, and subsequent shifts in registration behavior.
These inflection points reveal how policy change can amplify
vulnerability through owner noncompliance, disinvestment, or temporary
reporting distortions. The apparent rebound in 2024 reflects intensified
registration enforcement, not genuine replenishment of the regulated
stock, and therefore should be interpreted as a data correction rather
than a stabilization of long-term loss.</p>
<p><img src="figure1.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p style="font-size:0.8em; color:#666; text-align:center;">
<strong>Figure 1.</strong> NYC’s rent-stabilized housing stock has
steadily declined from 2015–2024, reducing a key layer of affordability
protection for many households.
</p>
<p>The figure below shows how stabilization coverage (Panel A) and
affordability pressure (Panel B) diverge across boroughs.</p>
<img src="table1.png" style="width:100.0%" />
<p style="font-size:0.8em; color:#666; text-align:center;">
</p>
<p>While the operational implications of this attrition are widely
understood within HPD, the communication challenges they introduce are
equally significant. The department must articulate complex patterns of
housing vulnerability to audiences that range from tenants and elected
officials to journalists and advocacy organizations, each with distinct
levels of technical knowledge and competing narratives about the causes
of instability. The CME’s responsibility is to shape a clear,
evidence-based account of these trends that guides outreach initiatives,
policy discussions, and builds trust in HPD’s preservation efforts.
Doing this effectively requires a narrative architecture that is
grounded in data, precise in its distinctions, and accessible enough to
counter oversimplification. The analysis that follows is designed to
support that communication function by translating structural housing
dynamics into a visual framework that clarifies where vulnerability is
intensifying and why it matters.</p>
<div id="protection-and-pressure-are-misaligned-across-boroughs"
class="section level4">
<h4>Protection and Pressure Are Misaligned Across Boroughs</h4>
<p>The citywide decline in rent-stabilized units establishes the scale
of the problem, but borough-level patterns reveal how its impacts are
uneven and why the challenge of addressing housing affordability is more
complex than a simple loss narrative suggests.</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows how regulatory protection and affordability pressures
are misaligned. Some boroughs face high rent burden despite extensive
stabilization coverage, while others have very limited stabilization but
still endure high cost pressures.</p>
<img src="figure2.png" style="width:100.0%" />
<p style="font-size:0.8em; color:#666; text-align:center;">
<strong>Figure 2.</strong> Stabilization coverage and rent-burden
indicators reveal two distinct borough-level forms of housing
vulnerability.
</p>
<p>This suggests that boroughs experience housing vulnerability through
different underlying mechanisms. In places with extensive stabilization,
like the Bronx, elevated rent-burden levels likely stem from conditions
intrinsic to the housing stock itself: older pre-war buildings with
significant capital needs, high-density multifamily structures that
concentrate maintenance risk, and ownership patterns that can exacerbate
deferred repair. In Queens, by contrast, limited stabilization coverage
means vulnerability is shaped by exposure to rent volatility in an
unregulated market.</p>
<p>This understanding establishes the analytical base the CME needs
before shifting to a finer spatial scale.</p>
</div>
<div
id="neighborhood-level-vulnerability-across-manhattan-the-bronx-and-queens"
class="section level4">
<h4>Neighborhood-Level Vulnerability Across Manhattan, the Bronx, and
Queens</h4>
<p>To capture neighborhood-level differences, the analysis constructs a
Community District Vulnerability Index (CDVI) based on three structural
indicators: the average age of the housing stock, the concentration of
units within multifamily buildings, and the share of rent-stabilized
housing. These drivers were selected because they correspond to areas
where HPD can intervene through preservation financing, code
enforcement, owner outreach, and stabilization-supporting programs.</p>
<p>The analysis focuses on Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens because
these boroughs exhibit the widest variation in building conditions,
housing density, and stabilization coverage. This heterogeneity makes
them the most informative for understanding how structural vulnerability
forms and where policy interventions may be most effectively deployed.
The interactive tool below organizes the CDVI and its component
indicators into three linked tabs that allow the CME to explore
vulnerability at multiple levels of detail. CDVI Map – a visualization
of overall vulnerability, highlighting districts in the highest bands
(typically scores above the mid-50s). Relative Ranking – a view of how
each district compares with others within the same borough, flagging
local outliers even where the borough average appears moderate.
Mini-Maps – isolates each underlying component, allowing the CME to see
where each structural driver is most geographically concentrated.
Hovering over a district displays its name; clicking reveals its
structural profile; zoom functions allow closer inspection of corridors
or boundary areas where conditions shift noticeably.</p>

<h4>Interpreting the Structural Drivers of Neighborhood
Vulnerability</h4>
<p>The narrative below is drawn directly from the interactions,
patterns, and district-level profiles surfaced through the tool. The
analysis aims to address two core questions:</p>
<p>Where in New York City is structural housing vulnerability most
acute, and what mechanisms explain these spatial patterns? How can these
differentiated mechanisms guide the CME in shaping targeted,
evidence-based communication that strengthens HPD’s outreach, policy
framing, and public trust?</p>
</div>
<div id="structural-determinants-of-elevated-housing-vulnerability"
class="section level4">
<h4>Structural Determinants of Elevated Housing Vulnerability</h4>
<p><u><strong>Districts with Complex, High-Load Multifamily
Systems</strong></u></p>
<p>The CDVI Map identifies Lower Manhattan (CDVI 65.4) as the
highest-vulnerability district. The underlying insight becomes clear
only when CDVI values are interpreted alongside the structural
mini-maps:</p>
<ul>
<li>The district contains significant pre-war elevator and walk-up stock
in the Chinatown and Lower East Side portions of the CD</li>
<li>These buildings rely on legacy electrical, ventilation, and
mechanical systems that are repeatedly flagged in DOB and HPD datasets
for their complexity and age</li>
<li>Dense vertical stacking amplifies exposure: failures in mechanical
systems affect entire risers or elevator banks</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these conditions produce a structural configuration where
aging systems and mechanical load drive elevated vulnerability.</p>
<p><u><strong>Districts Defined by Capital-Constrained Pre-War
Stock</strong></u></p>
<p>A second configuration appears in the central Bronx corridor,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hunts Point / Longwood (57.1)</li>
<li>Belmont / East Tremont (54.9)</li>
<li>Morrisania / Crotona (53.9)</li>
</ul>
<p>These neighborhoods contain some of NYC’s most concentrated
early-20th-century multifamily stock. HPD’s ERP and violation datasets
consistently document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chronic utility failures including repeated heat and hot-water
outages, and</li>
<li>Deteriorating building-envelope conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>The Relative Ranking view positions these districts significantly
above the Bronx median, indicating structural risk that outpaces
borough-wide patterns. Here, vulnerability arises from aging stock
compounded by long-term reinvestment deficits.</p>
<p><u><strong>Divergent Vulnerability Pathways Across
Queens</strong></u></p>
<p>The dashboard reveals that Queens’ highest-CDVI districts fall into
two contrasting structural patterns:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Density-Intensive Districts (e.g., LIC/Sunnyside 58.2; Astoria
56.9)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The mini-maps show large elevator buildings with high household
concentration</li>
<li>LIC is among the city’s fastest-growing housing nodes, increasing
mechanical and infrastructural load</li>
<li>The ranking chart places these districts well above the borough
median</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Aging Low-Rise Stock with Slow Reinvestment (e.g., Richmond
Hill/Woodhaven 58.1; Ozone Park 56.4)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>These areas contain older one- to three-family structures with
extended rehabilitation cycles</li>
<li>Vulnerability in these districts is driven by age-related
deterioration, rather than density or system load</li>
<li>The mini-maps isolate this pattern clearly: high building-age scores
paired with low density indicators</li>
</ul>
<p>Queens thus demonstrates structurally heterogeneous vulnerability
shaped by distinct local building forms and investment histories.</p>
</div>
<div
id="strategic-implications-for-hpds-communication-and-policy-alignment"
class="section level4">
<h4>Strategic Implications for HPD’s Communication and Policy
Alignment</h4>
<p>The insights above translate a complex risk landscape into a coherent
communication and coordination strategy.</p>
<p><u><strong>1. Anchor communication decisions in defensible,
data-driven prioritization</strong></u></p>
<p>The CDVI and within-borough ranking views give the CME a transparent
rationale for why certain districts should receive intensified
messaging, more frequent engagement with elected officials, or earlier
program rollouts. Instead of relying on anecdotal complaints or
political pressure, the CME can point to measurable deviation from
borough norms when justifying the concentration of tenant-rights
campaigns, owner-outreach initiatives, or enforcement visibility. This
creates a prioritization framework that is explainable, repeatable, and
aligned with HPD’s preservation mandate, reducing the risk of
accusations of inconsistency or inequity.</p>
<p><u><strong>2. Align messaging with the specific intervention levers
HPD controls</strong></u></p>
<p>Because each CDVI component corresponds to an HPD action
domain—rehabilitation finance, code enforcement, stabilization support,
and communication around tenant protections—the CME can tailor
communication to what HPD can actually deliver in each district, rather
than relying on broad, one-size-fits-all narratives.</p>
<p>The dashboard allows the CME to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pair communication about repair obligations with areas where
building systems are failing more often</li>
<li>Frame preservation financing as a response to structurally
documented reinvestment needs</li>
<li>Emphasize tenant-protection and stabilization messaging where the
regulated share of housing is low</li>
<li>Use structural evidence to articulate why program emphasis shifts
from district to district</li>
</ul>
<p>This ensures the public narrative is not only accurate, but
operationally grounded, strengthening HPD’s credibility.</p>
<p><u><strong>3. Translate structural insights into clear, anticipatory
policy framing</strong></u></p>
<p>The CDVI dashboard transparently reveals where building systems are
fragile, where reinvestment has lagged, or where dense housing
environments magnify operational failures. This allows the CME to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anticipate and address objections about uneven resource distribution
by showing how district-level conditions justify differentiated
responses</li>
<li>Equip elected officials and community leaders with clear, visual
evidence they can use when communicating with constituents</li>
<li>Shape media narratives by grounding explanations in the same spatial
logic reflected in the dashboard, reducing the risk of oversimplified or
adversarial interpretations</li>
</ul>
<p>In effect, the dashboard becomes a proactive communication tool,
allowing the CME to lead the narrative rather than respond to
misinterpretations after they emerge. This elevates HPD’s public
positioning by tying its decisions to transparent analytical reasoning,
strengthening credibility across stakeholder groups.</p>
