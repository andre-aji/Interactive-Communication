<h2>Understanding Housing Vulnerability in New York City</h2>
<p>New York City’s housing pressures have intensified over the past
decade, and their effects are not felt evenly across its neighborhoods.
Rising rent burdens, declining affordability protections, and aging
building stock intersect differently from one community district to
another. These patterns create not only operational challenges for HPD,
but also a strategic communications challenge: renters and property
owners experience risk locally, and HPD’s messages need to reach the
communities where those pressures are most acute.</p>
<p>For the Strategic Communications Division, a central question is
where residents are most exposed because affordability pressures and
regulatory protections are misaligned. Some boroughs experience high
rent burden despite robust stabilization coverage; others have very
limited stabilization yet still face rising costs. Understanding these
distinctions is essential for tailoring tenant-facing messaging,
preservation outreach, and multilingual communication strategies.</p>
<p>A second, equally important question is which neighborhoods within
each borough show overlapping signs of structural and affordability
risk. Vulnerability does not follow borough boundaries, and community
districts with similar citywide profiles can experience very different
conditions on the ground. To support more precise targeting, our
analysis integrates multiple dimensions of vulnerability—including rent
burden, stabilization coverage, building age, and density—into
neighborhood-level interactive tools designed to surface where risks are
most concentrated.</p>
<p>The two interactive visuals used throughout this brief—the borough
scatterplot and the multi-tab neighborhood explorer—allow HPD to move
from a citywide framing of the problem to a granular, district-level
understanding of where communication efforts can be most impactful.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Where are renters most exposed because affordability
pressures and stabilization protections are misaligned across
boroughs?</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>Within boroughs, which neighborhoods face overlapping
structural and affordability risks that justify more intensive
communications and outreach?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>To help address these questions, the following interactive visuals
provide an exploration of rental pressure, structural conditions, and
housing vulnerability across the city. The aim is to give HPD’s
Strategic Communications team a clearer sense of <em>where</em> risks
concentrate, <em>why</em> vulnerability takes different forms across
neighborhoods, and <em>how</em> communications can align more precisely
with on-the-ground realities faced by tenants and property owners.</p>
<p>Using these tools, we move from borough-level patterns to
neighborhood-level vulnerability, and ultimately to message strategies
that reflect the blend of affordability stress, stabilization coverage,
and building conditions that shape housing experiences across New York
City.</p>

class="section level2">
<h2>Borough-Level Misalignment: Where Pressure and Protection
Diverge</h2>
<p>Before turning to neighborhood-level patterns, it is important to
understand the borough-scale dynamics shaping renter exposure across New
York City. Affordability pressures and stabilization protections do not
move in parallel; some boroughs carry substantial rent burden despite
extensive rent-stabilized housing, while others have very limited
stabilization yet still face rising market pressures. For HPD’s
Strategic Communications Division, this misalignment helps determine
where tenant-facing messaging, program awareness campaigns, and
community outreach may need to be strengthened.</p>
<p>The borough scatterplot illustrates this relationship by positioning
each borough according to two core dimensions: affordability pressure
(measured through rent burden and severe burden) and stabilization
coverage (share of housing units under regulation). Boroughs that appear
higher on the chart experience greater affordability stress. Boroughs
that fall farther to the left have less stabilization coverage. Those
positioned <strong>high and to the left</strong> represent the city’s
most exposed borough-level conditions—where tenants face both high rent
strain and limited regulatory protection.</p>

<div id="interpreting-borough-level-patterns" class="section level3">
<h3>Interpreting Borough-Level Patterns</h3>
<p>Several distinctions become clear once the boroughs are viewed
through this dual lens:</p>
<p><strong>Queens and Staten Island</strong> stand out as areas with
relatively low stabilization coverage yet meaningful rent burden.
Tenants in these areas rely more heavily on market conditions and may
have less clarity around their rights. These boroughs represent strong
candidates for targeted communications around rental assistance
programs, tenant protections, and community-based resources.</p>
<p><strong>The Bronx</strong>, by contrast, shows the highest
stabilization coverage in the city but also the highest levels of rent
burden. These conditions highlight a form of vulnerability driven less
by regulatory gaps and more by structural income constraints.
Communications efforts here may benefit from emphasizing
anti-displacement protections, emergency rental assistance, and
preservation programs designed to support lower-income residents.</p>
<p><strong>Brooklyn and Manhattan</strong> fall somewhere in between,
with substantial stabilization coverage but continued affordability
pressure. These internal variations signal the need for finely tailored
messaging—clarifying both tenant protections and program pathways, while
acknowledging the diverse conditions across neighborhoods within each
borough.</p>
<p>Together, these borough-level findings set the stage for more
granular analysis. The next section introduces a neighborhood-level
vulnerability index to identify where, within each borough, overlapping
affordability and structural conditions create concentrated risk—and
where locally tailored communications may have the greatest impact.</p>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div
id="vulnerability-isnt-evenly-distributed-it-concentrates-in-specific-neighborhoods"
class="section level2">
<h2>Vulnerability Isn’t Evenly Distributed, It Concentrates in Specific
Neighborhoods</h2>
<p>The borough-level view highlights broad misalignments between
affordability pressure and stabilization protection, but these patterns
do not tell the whole story. Tenants experience housing pressure at the
neighborhood level, not the borough level. Within a single borough,
conditions can vary dramatically from one community district to the
next—differences in building age, density, stabilization coverage, and
rent burden that meaningfully shape how residents experience risk.</p>
<p>For HPD’s Strategic Communications Division, these neighborhood
differences are especially important. Citywide narratives about
affordability and protection only go so far; targeted campaigns,
community engagement, and informational outreach depend on understanding
where vulnerabilities cluster most intensely and why.</p>
<p>To capture this finer-grained picture, our analysis introduces the
<strong>Composite District Vulnerability Index (CDVI)</strong>, a
neighborhood-level measure that integrates affordability strain,
structural conditions, and stabilization access. The goal is not to
assign a single number to each community, but to highlight where
<strong>multiple forms of exposure converge</strong>—places where
communications interventions are likely to have the greatest impact.</p>
<p>This section addresses our second core question:</p>
<p><strong>Which neighborhoods exhibit the greatest combination of
affordability and structural vulnerabilities, indicating a need for more
intensive, locally tailored communication strategies?</strong></p>
<p>To explore these patterns, the multi-tab interactive tool below
provides three coordinated views:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CDVI Map</strong> — a citywide visualization of overall
vulnerability,<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Relative Ranking</strong> — how each district compares with
others within the same borough.</li>
<li><strong>Mini-Maps</strong> — the structural drivers behind
vulnerability, including building age, density, and stabilization
share</li>
</ul>
<p>Before moving into district-specific insights, begin by exploring the
<strong>CDVI Map</strong> tab within the embedded tool. Hovering over a
district will display its name; clicking reveals its CDVI score and
component indicators. The ability to zoom and pan supports closer
inspection of specific corridors or border areas.</p>
<p>This neighborhood-level view sets the foundation for understanding
not only <em>where</em> vulnerability is concentrated, but <em>why</em>
certain districts warrant deeper, more tailored communication
efforts.</p>

<div

class="section level2">
<h2>Identifying the Neighborhoods Where Overlapping Pressures Demand
Targeted Communication</h2>
<p>As you explore the CDVI map, a clear pattern emerges: housing
vulnerability in New York City does not follow borough borders or broad
geographic divides. Instead, it concentrates in specific community
districts where affordability pressures, structural conditions, and
stabilization gaps reinforce one another. The darker red areas on the
map mark districts where these overlapping risks are most acute.</p>
<p>Several clusters stand out immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower Manhattan</strong>, including the Lower East Side,
Chinatown, and parts of Tribeca, reflects elevated vulnerability driven
by older housing stock combined with dense multifamily buildings and
persistent affordability pressures.</li>
<li><strong>Western Queens</strong>, particularly Long Island City,
Sunnyside, and Astoria, shows a rapid accumulation of risk as rising
rents, higher-density buildings, and uneven stabilization coverage
converge.</li>
<li>The <strong>South Bronx</strong>, including Hunts Point and
Longwood, highlights a different form of exposure—one where extensive
stabilization coverage exists but deep income constraints and aging
buildings continue to drive vulnerability.</li>
<li>Portions of <strong>southern Brooklyn</strong> also register higher
CDVI scores, shaped by mixed building stock, growing affordability
strain, and lower stabilization rates in certain pockets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, neighborhoods in <strong>northern Manhattan</strong>, the
<strong>central Bronx</strong>, and <strong>eastern Queens</strong> tend
to exhibit lower vulnerability scores. In these areas, stabilization
protections, somewhat newer building stock, or lower structural strain
help moderate overall risk—even if affordability remains a concern.</p>
<p>For Strategic Communications, districts with higher CDVI scores
represent <strong>priority outreach zones</strong>. These are areas
where coordinated, neighborhood-specific messaging can have the greatest
impact—whether that involves educating tenants about their rights,
connecting residents with rental assistance programs, clarifying
stabilization rules, or supporting property owners with guidance on
maintenance, preservation programs, and code compliance.</p>
<p>The CDVI map sets the foundation for understanding
<strong>where</strong> vulnerability is most concentrated. The next step
is to examine <strong>why</strong> these patterns take the shape they do
by looking at the structural drivers behind them.</p>
<div id="pinpointing-outliers-within-each-borough"
class="section level3">
<h3>Pinpointing Outliers Within Each Borough</h3>
<p>While the CDVI map highlights citywide patterns, the “Relative
Ranking” tab helps reveal something equally important for Strategic
Communications: which neighborhoods stand out <em>within</em> their own
borough. A district may not look extreme on a citywide map, but if it
sits far above its borough’s median vulnerability, it represents a local
outlier where residents experience meaningfully greater strain than
their immediate surroundings.</p>
<p>When you switch to the “Relative Ranking” view, each point represents
a community district, positioned relative to the median CDVI for its
borough. Districts that fall well to the right of the vertical zero line
show elevated vulnerability compared with their borough norm.</p>
<p>Across the boroughs, several themes emerge:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>Manhattan</strong>, vulnerability tends to reflect
layered pressures — older buildings, high density, and persistent
affordability strain — creating multiple districts that sit above the
borough median.</li>
<li>In <strong>Queens</strong>, a handful of neighborhoods in the
western part of the borough stand out clearly, even though Queens
overall appears moderate in the citywide distribution.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Bronx</strong>, many districts cluster above the
median, reinforcing that affordability pressures and aging stock are
widespread and deeply rooted.</li>
</ul>
<p>For HPD’s Communications Division, these borough-level contrasts
offer a practical guide for prioritization. Districts that consistently
sit above their borough median should be treated as <strong>priority
communication zones</strong>, where targeted outreach, multilingual
messaging, and coordinated efforts with community organizations can be
most impactful. This view complements the CDVI map by ensuring that even
within high-need boroughs, the neighborhoods with the most concentrated
risk receive focused attention.</p>
</div>
<div
id="why-vulnerability-looks-different-across-neighborhoods-the-structural-drivers"
class="section level3">
<h3>Why Vulnerability Looks Different Across Neighborhoods: The
Structural Drivers</h3>
<p>The CDVI highlights where vulnerability is concentrated, but the
“Mini-Maps” tab helps explain <em>why</em>. By examining building age,
density, and stabilization coverage, clear structural patterns emerge
that shape local conditions and guide how communications should be
tailored.</p>
<div id="building-age" class="section level4">
<h4>Building Age</h4>
<p>Districts with older housing stock—especially in
<strong>Manhattan</strong>, the <strong>Bronx</strong>, and parts of
<strong>northwestern Queens</strong>—face higher maintenance needs and
infrastructure strain. These areas benefit from owner-focused messaging
on preservation and repairs, alongside tenant communications that
clarify how to report unsafe conditions.</p>
</div>
<div id="density" class="section level4">
<h4>Density</h4>
<p>Higher-density buildings, most visible in <strong>Manhattan</strong>,
<strong>western Queens</strong>, and sections of
<strong>Brooklyn</strong>, amplify the impact of system failures.
Communications here should emphasize building-wide safety, emergency
preparedness, and coordinated reporting for large multifamily
buildings.</p>
</div>
<div id="stabilization-coverage" class="section level4">
<h4>Stabilization Coverage</h4>
<p>Stabilization varies widely across the city. The
<strong>Bronx</strong>, <strong>Upper Manhattan</strong>, and central
areas of <strong>Brooklyn</strong> and <strong>Queens</strong> show
stronger coverage, while <strong>Staten Island</strong> and parts of
<strong>eastern Queens</strong> do not.<br />
- Low-stabilization areas: focus on rights in market-rate housing and
rental assistance resources.<br />
- High-stabilization areas: highlight protections, enforcement pathways,
and legal recourse.</p>
<p>Together, these structural layers clarify why certain districts score
higher on the CDVI—and help HPD shape messaging that aligns with the
specific pressures residents face in each neighborhood.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div
id="closing-reflections-where-vulnerability-converges-and-why-it-matters-for-communications"
class="section level2">
<h2>Closing Reflections: Where Vulnerability Converges and Why It
Matters for Communications</h2>
<p>Across all three visuals, one theme stands out: housing vulnerability
in New York City is shaped by <em>where</em> affordability pressure and
regulatory protections misalign, and <em>why</em> those pressures
concentrate in certain neighborhoods. At the borough level, the
scatterplot shows two distinct forms of exposure—places with limited
stabilization despite meaningful rent burden, and places where deep
affordability strain persists even within a largely stabilized stock.
Each scenario demands a different communications approach, whether
clarifying rights in unregulated housing or strengthening messaging
around protections, resources, and enforcement.</p>
<p>The neighborhood-level lens sharpens these patterns further. The CDVI
map highlights districts where multiple pressures converge—aging
buildings, dense multifamily stock, and elevated rent burden appearing
together. These are the communities where renters and owners are most
likely to experience instability or uncertainty, and where
communications must be localized, proactive, and multilingual. These
high-vulnerability districts emerge consistently in parts of lower
Manhattan, western Queens, the South Bronx, and sections of
Brooklyn.</p>
<p>The structural driver maps then clarify <em>why</em> these
neighborhoods stand out. In some districts, vulnerability is rooted in
older infrastructure; in others, in the scale and density of buildings;
in others, in limited stabilization coverage. This breakdown makes it
possible for HPD to match message content to neighborhood
realities—whether emphasizing maintenance and safety in dense corridors
or tenant rights and protections where stabilization is thin.</p>
<p>Taken together, the unified tool provides a clearer path for HPD to
target communications where they will matter most. It shows which
communities face the greatest exposure, what forms that exposure takes,
and how message design can better reflect on-the-ground conditions. By
grounding communications strategy in these spatial patterns, HPD can
reach the right audiences with the right information at the right
time—strengthening both tenant stability and neighborhood
resilience.</p>
